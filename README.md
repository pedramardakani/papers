# Study and optimization of confocal circular multipass absorption cells

Abstract: The optimization of circular multipass absorption cells used in Laser Absorption Spectroscopy has been studied in this paper. In this case, segmented confocal circular multipass cells were selected and parameters related to measurement sensitivity, cell dimensions and optical stability of the cell towards vibrations and mechanical tensions were studied. Investigating intensity profile of output beam using wave-optics approach, indicates the advantages of utilizing segmented circular multipass cells.

# Investigation of an experimental method in reducing laser line width effect in Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS)

Abstract: 
Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) is an appropriate laser-based spectroscopic technique for the quantitative diagnosis of molecular species. Precise measurement of molecular densities can be achieved by recording spectra with reliable intensities. This is possible when the laser line width is much narrower than absorption feature. For experimental setups in which, laser line width is broader than absorber line width, an experimental technique can be used to record relatively reliable spectra. In this technique, it is necessary to fit the exponential decay of the ring-down signal using only the data close to the beginning of the ring-down signal. This paper provides a theoretical investigation into experimental method. It is found that using this technique is valid to record reliable spectra which are less affected by laser line width.
