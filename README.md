# A Hybrid VLC/RF Parking Automation System

> A. Madahian, P. A. Ardakani, J. Abouei, A. Mirvakili, A. Mohammadi and V. Koomson, "A Hybrid VLC/RF Parking Automation System," in IEEE Access, vol. 11, pp. 66960-66978, 2023, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3290847.

**Abstract:**
This paper proposes an innovative and integrated parking automation system based on visible light communication (VLC) and radio frequency (RF) wireless technologies. The VLC and RF are used for vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, infrastructure-to-vehicle communication, indoor localization, and wireless mesh networks. For VLC we have utilized the vehicle’s headlight and parking COB bulb-based VLC transmitters and optical receivers that are installed on the parking gate barrier and the roof of the vehicle. Digital pulse interval modulation (DPIM) is used as an anisochronous modulation scheme in VLC-based transactions. The client-server interface and parking’s central processing unit are implemented using the ParkLight software package consisting of an Android, Django, and LabVIEW PC-based applications. We have introduced a VLC-based two-factor authentication and a charging payment system for installation at the gate barrier. An experimental evaluation of the proposed system is conducted under both day and night conditions in terms of optical interference cancellation, angular displacement, and the transmission link range. In addition, the VLC-based positioning system is practically evaluated under different LEDs’ semiangle at half-power. The proposed system is successfully demonstrated by achieving a bit error rate (BER) of less than 10<sup>−4</sup> over a 5 m link range, and an average positioning error lower than 0.7 m for vehicles.

**Abstract:** The optimization of circular multipass absorption cells used in Laser Absorption Spectroscopy has been studied in this paper. In this case, segmented confocal circular multipass cells were selected and parameters related to measurement sensitivity, cell dimensions and optical stability of the cell towards vibrations and mechanical tensions were studied. Investigating intensity profile of output beam using wave-optics approach, indicates the advantages of utilizing segmented circular multipass cells.

# Investigation of an experimental method in reducing laser line width effect in Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS)

**Abstract:** Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) is an appropriate laser-based spectroscopic technique for the quantitative diagnosis of molecular species. Precise measurement of molecular densities can be achieved by recording spectra with reliable intensities. This is possible when the laser line width is much narrower than absorption feature. For experimental setups in which, laser line width is broader than absorber line width, an experimental technique can be used to record relatively reliable spectra. In this technique, it is necessary to fit the exponential decay of the ring-down signal using only the data close to the beginning of the ring-down signal. This paper provides a theoretical investigation into experimental method. It is found that using this technique is valid to record reliable spectra which are less affected by laser line width.
